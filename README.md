Current Bugs:
* None known

Ideas to implement:
* Gather all champions skin and see how long you can name them within a timer.
* Name all champions from their splash art
* Challenge mode - must include full splash art name + champion
* Link to Discord / Github link
* Improve responsive design for mobile devices
* Add a stuck button
